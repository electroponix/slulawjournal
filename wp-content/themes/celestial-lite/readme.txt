    Introduction:
-------------------------------------------------------

Celestial is designed with a clean business style that is capable of handling almost any kind of business or personal website. You will find that Celestial is not only flexible, but it's scalable, and will last you a very long time. One of the big bonuses of Celestial (the free version) is that I've included the Twitter Bootstrap framework for responsive mobility on your favourite devices like the iPhone, iPads, Android phones, and others.

    Theme Capability:
-------------------------------------------------------

Celestial Lite comes with a different options panel for making custom changes to the visual aspects of this theme which is the Theme Customization API but not the Settings API - But we will call it the Theme Customizer. Accessing this customizer is done from one of two locations:

1. Your Dashboard home page by clicking on the big "Customize this Site" button (if this theme is active)
2. Going to Appearance >> Themes >> Clicking on the text link "Customize" on the active theme

This theme offers a lot of options, including unlimited colours for most page elements from text colour to backgrounds and even borders. Celestial Lite also comes with the built-in WordPress header feature that is used in the Showcase area and will show up on every page including your front page, although you do get a setting that can disable this on every page but the front page. There is also the ability to set images or sliders using a widget (I recommend the Advanced Text Widget) for the showcase instead of the WP Header feature. 

You page background feature setting will also let you have a custom page background for any pages that are shorter than the browser view, otherwise, this theme is designed to expand full width.

You also get the ability to change colours for almost everything you see in your page with unlimited colour combinations 
to help you create your own personalized style with the built-in customizer.

You can make many changes to your theme from the customizer, such as:

1. Changing your site title and site description
2. Selecting and changing your logo
3. Changing your theme website colours for almost every thing in your pages
4. Customize the Showcase Header area.
5. Changing the page background (only viewable when you have a shorter page than the browser window).
6. Choosing your menu and customizing it
7. Choosing if you want a static page for your front page or keeping it as the blog

    WARNING: BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------

Please do not edit style.css or any other Theme files or Templates directly. 
If you do, your customizations will be lost as soon as you update this theme.

WordPress and Styled Themes highly recommends using a Child Theme.
