Description: Easily create custom styles which will be added to the dropdown style selector in TinyMCE.

== Description ==
If you have ever wanted to create custom styles for your clients to easily select, then this is the plugin for you.  Now you can add all your custom styles through an admin panel interface, and the styles will be applied to three areas of the website:

1. The styles will appear in the dropdown selector inside TinyMCE.
2. The applied style will reflect in the tinymce editor box for any post/page.
3. The applied style will also be reflected on the front end of the website.

This plugin is the first step at bridging the gap of allowing novice Wordpress users to easily create custom styles which can be applied through the tinymce editor to all of their post/page content.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Visit the newly created options page under the "Settings" menu to configure your styles.
